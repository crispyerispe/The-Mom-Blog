                              Being a mother isn't an easy job but being a teen
                              mom has a whole other set of challenges.
                              Challenges ranging from people's judgements to
                              altering your perception of how you thought your
                              life was going to go.

                                    that's fine, it's all part of it… But you
                                    have just got to take a step back and
                                    realize that you have just got to ride with
                                    the waves. Once you have your baby in your
                                    arms, it is genuinely all worth it.”

                              Being a teen mom is tough because most people your
                              age are partying, out all the time, and sometimes
                              you feel like you're missing out. I have
                              experienced that but then I tell myself there will
                              be other opportunities to party. Partying isn't
                              everything - your child is. Balancing school,
                              having a child and having a social life wasn't as
                              hard as I thought it would be - my friends
                              understood things were going to be different and
                              they adapted well. Dealing with judgements from
                              other especially when trying to date. It's quite
                              and it takes a strong perso to be unaffected by
                              those kinds of hurtful words. I remember a time
                              when I was still pregnant and at school and people
                              would stare but literally did not care because
                              their opinions of me didn't define me. It was me
                              and my baby and that's all I cared about. I was at
                              peace with having a baby so other's opinions did
                              not affect me. <br />
                              Becoming a mother has really humbled me and given
                              my life a new direction. I believe that this is
                              what was set out for me and babies are blessings.
                              I am truly blessed to have been given such an
                              amazing son.

                                  A few things to remember
                                </h3>
                                1. "You are doing a great job." <br />
                                Every mom knows that what we do every day is
                                hard work. Some may argue that it's the hardest
                                job in the world (it is definitely the hardest
                                job I have ever had). It feels great when
                                someone else recognizes your effort and
                                acknowledges that we are doing it well.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                              </div>
                            </div>
                            2. "No one is as perfect as they seem on social
                            media." This is a big one for me. While I will admit
                            that I get caught up in the world of social media,
                            it is so important to be able to separate that out
                            from reality. I personally don't often post those
                            moments when I just yelled at my child or was unkind
                            to my husband for no reason. So why would I assume
                            that anyone else is? Just because we don't see
                            others having these moments, does not mean they are
                            not happening.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <div>
                              3. "It's okay if you feel like you're losing it
                              sometimes." <br />
                              Kids will do that to you! There will be moments as
                              a mother when you do not feel particularly proud
                              of your behavior. At times, you may feel like you
                              have no control and it's normal to feel this way.
                              It happens to the best of us. Use this as your
                              reminder to pause and make sure you are making
                              space for yourself in this busy life.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                            </div>
                            <div>
                              4. "Do you need a break?" <br />
                              Self-care is essential for everyone, but as a mom,
                              you can't survive without it. Take a long shower
                              when your partner gets home or when you get home
                              from work, grab a cup of coffee with a friend or
                              just have some out time. Taking a break from your
                              children will allow you to return to them with a
                              better capacity to give them what they need.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                            </div>
                            <div className="article-information">
                              <div>
                                5. "Trust your instincts." There are so many
                                conflicting opinions out there about what we
                                should and should not be doing when it comes to
                                raising our children. And while a lot of those
                                opinions are based on research, none of them are
                                based on your child. You know your child better
                                than any expert or professional out there.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                6. "You are not alone." One of the best things
                                about motherhood (outside of our extraordinary
                                kids of course) is the community of other moms
                                that exist out there. I think it is pretty safe
                                to say that for everything you have felt as a
                                mom, there is another mother who will be able to
                                relate to it. Knowing that other mamas have
                                walked this exact same path before you is an
                                incredibly powerful tool in getting through
                                those tough moments.
