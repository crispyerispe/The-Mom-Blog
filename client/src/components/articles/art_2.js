                              heading as I always said I'd love to be a young
                              mother but I didn't mean that young. <br />

                              When I found out I was pregnant I did not expect
                              to feel the way I did. Weirdly I wasn't stressed
                              out, scared or worried. I contemplated an abortion
                              but as my and sister and I laid in my bed we felt
                              a kick and I knew then that this was my child and
                              I am going to be its mother. I still hdn't told my
                              parents and was quite nervous to tell them - I was
                              scared for their reaction or what they were going
                              to do but thankfully they were accepting of it and
                              said we'll handle it together as a family. I was
                              about 6 months when they found out. The day after
                              they found out I went for my first scan and
                              everything went well. Baby was healthy, no defects
                              and I was in good codition. <br />
                              I had a great pregnancy - no morning sicness, no
                              swelling or weight gain. I gained 2.9kg and lost
                              it as soon as I gave birth. I had a good birthing
                              experience as well. I am terrified of needles so I
                              told my OBGYN I want a natural delivery and no
                              epidural and that's exactly how I gave birth. I am
                              very thankful for no complications in both my
                              pregnancy and birth - I was very blessed for that
                              as I've heard some real horror birth stories. I
                              was induced the night before and the next morning
                              the nurse woke me up and said we are ready to get
                              started. My doctor came in broke my water at about
                              8am. From there the contraction began. I found
                              that moving around and bouncing on the exercise
                              ball helped relief pain. The nurse would
                              constantly come in to check how far I've dialated.
                              They dialating from 1-3cm take sthe longest but
                              after 3cm it increases fast and that's exactly
                              what happened. Eventually the pain got too hectic
                              for me to walk anymore so I laid on the bed and
                              the hoked me to this horrible machine that
                              restricts your movement but it's to moniter
                              contractions and baby's heartbeat. As time was
                              going I was telling them the whole time that I
                              need to poop and on the last time they came in to
                              check they said that the baby's head was crowning
                              - so the whole time I thought I needed to poop, I
                              was actually pushing my son out and I didn't even
                              realise it. My OBGYN came in and I started pushing
                              for real. Nothing like what they show in the
                              movies. I didn't scream because I needed to focus
                              on pushing correctly and on time so I don't tear.
                              Eventually my son was born at past 11am. I stayed
                              at the hospital for the required 2 days and an
                              extra day because I had a slight fever.
                              <br />
                              After birth, I laid in the maternity ward thinking
                              how am I going to do this but then I remembered I
                              have my family and my friends and that I've got
                              this. Never questioned it ever since.

                                  A few things to remember
                                </h3>
                                1. "You are doing a great job." <br />
                                Every mom knows that what we do every day is
                                hard work. Some may argue that it's the hardest
                                job in the world (it is definitely the hardest
                                job I have ever had). It feels great when
                                someone else recognizes your effort and
                                acknowledges that we are doing it well.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                              </div>
                            </div>
                            2. "No one is as perfect as they seem on social
                            media." This is a big one for me. While I will admit
                            that I get caught up in the world of social media,
                            it is so important to be able to separate that out
                            from reality. I personally don't often post those
                            moments when I just yelled at my child or was unkind
                            to my husband for no reason. So why would I assume
                            that anyone else is? Just because we don't see
                            others having these moments, does not mean they are
                            not happening.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <div>
                              3. "It's okay if you feel like you're losing it
                              sometimes." <br />
                              Kids will do that to you! There will be moments as
                              a mother when you do not feel particularly proud
                              of your behavior. At times, you may feel like you
                              have no control and it's normal to feel this way.
                              It happens to the best of us. Use this as your
                              reminder to pause and make sure you are making
                              space for yourself in this busy life.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                            </div>
                            <div>
                              4. "Do you need a break?" <br />
                              Self-care is essential for everyone, but as a mom,
                              you can't survive without it. Take a long shower
                              when your partner gets home or when you get home
                              from work, grab a cup of coffee with a friend or
                              just have some out time. Taking a break from your
                              children will allow you to return to them with a
                              better capacity to give them what they need.

                                5. "Trust your instincts." There are so many
                                conflicting opinions out there about what we
                                should and should not be doing when it comes to
                                raising our children. And while a lot of those
                                opinions are based on research, none of them are
                                based on your child. You know your child better
                                than any expert or professional out there.

                                6. "You are not alone." One of the best things
                                about motherhood (outside of our extraordinary
                                kids of course) is the community of other moms
                                that exist out there. I think it is pretty safe
                                to say that for everything you have felt as a
                                mom, there is another mother who will be able to
                                relate to it. Knowing that other mamas have
                                walked this exact same path before you is an
                                incredibly powerful tool in getting through
                                those tough moments.
