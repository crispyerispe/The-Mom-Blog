                              I think it's safe to say the first year of being a
                              mom is definitely the toughest - not to say the
                              rest of it is a walk in the park but it takes
                              adjusting to. <br />

                              There's no guide on how to be a good parent. It's
                              all trial and error and in the first year there is
                              so much trial and error. During my first year I
                              had to get used to the fact that it was not all
                              about me anymore. Being a young mother it was a
                              major adjustment for me because I was so used
                              doing whatever I wanted, whenever I want but I
                              quickly came into the mother role. My first year
                              of being a mom was a whirlwind to say the least. I
                              was balancing being a mother, high school student,
                              working on and off and being social. It was tough
                              but luckily I had very supportive friends and
                              family who helped me through this journey - I am
                              very thankful for them because without them I
                              wouldn't have ended up where I am today. <br />
                              My first year was certainly a year of learning and
                              growth. A year full of happiness, excitement, fear
                              but most importantly conquering obstacles. I look
                              foward to the rest of my journey as a mother as
                              there's no better reward than that of being a
                              parent.

                                  A few things to remember
                                </h3>
                                1. "You are doing a great job." <br />
                                Every mom knows that what we do every day is
                                hard work. Some may argue that it's the hardest
                                job in the world (it is definitely the hardest
                                job I have ever had). It feels great when
                                someone else recognizes your effort and
                                acknowledges that we are doing it well.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                              </div>
                            </div>
                            2. "No one is as perfect as they seem on social
                            media." This is a big one for me. While I will admit
                            that I get caught up in the world of social media,
                            it is so important to be able to separate that out
                            from reality. I personally don't often post those
                            moments when I just yelled at my child or was unkind
                            to my husband for no reason. So why would I assume
                            that anyone else is? Just because we don't see
                            others having these moments, does not mean they are
                            not happening.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            <div>
                              3. "It's okay if you feel like you're losing it
                              sometimes." <br />
                              Kids will do that to you! There will be moments as
                              a mother when you do not feel particularly proud
                              of your behavior. At times, you may feel like you
                              have no control and it's normal to feel this way.
                              It happens to the best of us. Use this as your
                              reminder to pause and make sure you are making
                              space for yourself in this busy life.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                            </div>
                            <div>
                              4. "Do you need a break?" <br />
                              Self-care is essential for everyone, but as a mom,
                              you can't survive without it. Take a long shower
                              when your partner gets home or when you get home
                              from work, grab a cup of coffee with a friend or
                              just have some out time. Taking a break from your
                              children will allow you to return to them with a
                              better capacity to give them what they need.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                            </div>
                            <div className="article-information">
                              <div>
                                5. "Trust your instincts." There are so many
                                conflicting opinions out there about what we
                                should and should not be doing when it comes to
                                raising our children. And while a lot of those
                                opinions are based on research, none of them are
                                based on your child. You know your child better
                                than any expert or professional out there.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                6. "You are not alone." One of the best things
                                about motherhood (outside of our extraordinary
                                kids of course) is the community of other moms
                                that exist out there. I think it is pretty safe
                                to say that for everything you have felt as a
                                mom, there is another mother who will be able to
                                relate to it. Knowing that other mamas have
                                walked this exact same path before you is an
                                incredibly powerful tool in getting through
                                those tough moments.
